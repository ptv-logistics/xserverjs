JavaScript samples for [PTV xServer](http://xserver.ptvgroup.com/home/ptv-xserver-en/)

Live demo https://ptv-logistics.github.io/xserverjs/ 

## Usage

* Clone the repository or download the zip file
* Add your xserver-internet token at token.js
* To use samples with your on-premise xServer, replace the urls in the corresponding index.html file for your xServer url.
* **Note:** Some samples need to access local files via ajax. If you want to load your own data, they have to be hosted inside a web server.
